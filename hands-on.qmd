# Hands-on

## Libraries

Here we load the necessary libraries for our hands-on session.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
library(ggraph)
library(mapview)
library(sf)
library(sfnetworks)
library(tidygraph)
library(tidyverse)

## Optional libraries depending on the tasks you pick:
library(osmdata)
library(spatstat.linnet)
```

## Data

A common source for open geospatial network data is OpenStreetMap (<https://www.openstreetmap.org>), a crowd-sourced map platform. 

We use OpenStreetMap data for the hands-on session and we do so using the `osmdata` package, which is the R interface to the Overpass API of OpenStreetMap.

:::{.callout-tip}
For larger networks, it is **not recommended** to use the Overpass API for data retrieval. You can better download an OpenStreetMap extract (for example from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/)) and read it into R using the `osmextract` package.
:::

[**We have prepared some data for you, so that we don't overwhelm the OpenStreetMap API**]{style="color:orange;"}. 
However, this section includes code if you are interested on how to retrieve the data for yourself.

We also queried data from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) with `rinat`. And have also saved this into a dataset for your convenience.

### Cape Town datasets

If you choose [Nicolaas](@sec-nicolaas), [Annika](@sec-annika) or [Kaya](@sec-kaya), you will be working with data in Cape Town. We provide you with the following datasets:

::: panel-tabset

## Road network

- The [Cape Town road network](data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_osm_roads.gpkg) data was queried from OpenStreetMap, using the "highway" key.
  
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to query road data from OSM"

library(osmdata)
# Set bounding box
bounds = "Cape Town Ward 115, South Africa"
# Obtain Cape Town from OSM
bb = getbb(bounds, format_out = 'sf_polygon')

## Roads
# Download OSM data for Cape Town, with the key=highway
roads = opq(bounds) |>
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway") |>
  osmdata_sf() |> 
  osm_poly2line()
# Create a LINESTRING sf object with selected columns
lines = roads |> 
  pluck("osm_lines") |> 
  st_intersection(bb) |> 
  filter(st_is(geometry, c("LINESTRING", "MULTILINESTRING"))) |> 
  st_cast("LINESTRING") |> 
  dplyr::select(
    name, 'type' = highway, 
    maxspeed, surface, 
    lanes, oneway, cycleway
  )|> 
  filter(!type %in% c("bus_stop", "elevator", "steps", "busway",
                      "corridor", "track", "living_street", NA))

write_sf(
  lines,
  "data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_osm_roads.gpkg"
)
```

- The data is saved as a geopackage (.gpkg). You can load the data using the `sf` package and then convert it into a sfnetwork. PS. we rename the "geom" column to "geometry" due to a small bug with `ggraph` and called the object `ct_roads`
  
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to load the data"
ct_roads = read_sf(
  "data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_osm_roads.gpkg"
) |> 
  rename(geometry = geom)
```

## POIs

- In the tasks below you will find different people who need help with spatial networks. We have compiled here a number of [points of interest (POIs)](data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_pois.gpkg) that you will need to complete the tasks. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me for code to create a sf from point coordinates"
## POIs in CT
pois = st_sfc(
  st_point(c(-33.922584,18.426465)),
  st_point(c(-33.909360,18.422753)),
  st_point(c(-33.917620,18.422291)),
  crs = 4326
) |> 
  st_as_sf(place = c(
      "Cape Town Station",
      "Radisson Red Hotel",
      "AfricaWorks CBD"
  )
)

write_sf(pois, "data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_pois.gpkg")
```

- You can use `sf` to load this data. Remember our "geom" rename trick. We called this object `ct_pois`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to load the data"
ct_pois = read_sf(
  "data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_pois.gpkg"
) |> 
  rename(geometry = geom)
```

## Coffee places

- Finally, to help Annika you will need the location of [coffee places in Cape Town](data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_cafes.gpkg). For this we queried all the coffee places within the bounds used for the query of the Cape Town road network.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me for code to query coffee places from OSM"
## Coffee places in CT
ct_cafes_osm = opq(bounds) |>
  add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "cafe") |>
  osmdata_sf() 

ct_cafes = bind_rows(
  ct_cafes_osm$osm_points,
  st_centroid(ct_cafes_osm$osm_polygons)
)

write_sf(ct_cafes, "data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_cafes.gpkg")
```

- You can use `sf` to load this data. Remember our "geom" rename trick. We called this object `ct_cafes`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to load the data"
ct_cafes = read_sf(
  "data/south-africa/cape-town/cape_town_cafes.gpkg"
) |> 
  rename(geometry = geom)
```

### Kruger datasets

If you choose [Joseph](@sec-joseph) or [Amina](@sec-amina), you will be working in Kruger National Park. We prepared the following datasets:

::: panel-tabset

## Road network

- The [Kruger NP road](data/south-africa/kruger/kruger_osm_roads.gpkg) data was queried from OpenStreetMap, using the "highway" key.
  
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to query road data from OSM"

library(osmdata)
## Bounding box
area = "Kruger National Park, South Africa"
# Obtain Kruger NP boundary from OSM
bb = getbb(area, format_out = 'sf_polygon')

## Roads
# Download OSM data for Kruger NP, with the key=highway
roads = opq(area) |>
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway") |>
  osmdata_sf() |> 
  osm_poly2line()
# Create a LINESTRING sf object with selected columns
lines = roads |> 
  pluck("osm_lines") |> 
  st_intersection(bb) |> 
  filter(st_is(geometry, c("LINESTRING", "MULTILINESTRING"))) |> 
  st_cast("LINESTRING") |> 
  dplyr::select(
    name, 'type' = highway, 
    maxspeed, surface
  )

write_sf(lines, "data/south-africa/kruger/kruger_osm_roads.gpkg")
```

- The data is saved as a geopackage (.gpkg). You can load the data using the `sf` package and then convert it into a sfnetwork. PS. we rename the "geom" column to "geometry" due to a small bug with `ggraph`.
  
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to load the data"
kruger_roads = read_sf(
  "data/south-africa/kruger/kruger_osm_roads.gpkg"
) |> 
  rename(geometry = geom)
```

## Animal sightings

- We queried [mammals' sightings](data/south-africa/kruger/kruger_mammalia_inaturalist.csv) data from iNaturalist. We limited the sightings to Mammals and check on their website the corresponding `place_id` for Kruger National Park

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me for code to query animal sightings from iNaturalist"
library(rinat)
kruger_animals = get_inat_obs(
  geo = TRUE,
  taxon_name = "Mammalia",
  place_id = 69020, # Kruger National Park
  maxresults = 2500,
  year = 2024
) |> select(-c(sound_url, oauth_application_id))

# Save to CSV
write_csv(
  kruger_animals,
  "data/south-africa/kruger/kruger_mammalia_inaturalist.csv"
)
```

- The data is saved as a CSV file. You can use `readr`, part of the `tidyverse` package bundle to read this in.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Unfold me to see how to read CSV data"
test = read_csv(
  "data/south-africa/kruger/kruger_mammalia_inaturalist.csv",
  show_col_types = TRUE
)
```

## Pre-processing

::: panel-tabset
## [**1. Creating the network**]{style="color:orange;"}

The retrieved streets from OpenStreetMap can be converted into a sfnetwork object, and projected into the South African CRS.

Try to create the sfnetwork yourself. 
You can check the package documentation to help you. 
For network creation you can type `?as_sfnetwork` on your console.

If you are stuck, check the solution code on the next tabs.

## Cape Town

```{r}
ct_sfn = as_sfnetwork(ct_roads, directed = FALSE) |>
  st_transform(22293)

ct_sfn
```

## Kruger

```{r}
kruger_sfn = as_sfnetwork(kruger_roads, directed = FALSE) |>
  st_transform(22293)

kruger_sfn
```
:::

::: panel-tabset
## [**2. Cleaning the network**]{style="color:orange;"}

A typical workflow to clean a network was shown in the introductory part. 
Remember when we talked about cleaning the dirty network?
For networks queried from OpenStreetMap, it is particularly important to clean your network. 
You can find more information in the package vignette [vignette name here]().

This is a recap of the usual steps:

a. Subdivide the edges
b. Smooth pseudo nodes
c. Extract the largest component

If you got stuck and can't remember the code, see the next tabs.

## Cape Town

```{r}
ct_sfn_clean = ct_sfn |>
  convert(to_spatial_subdivision) |>
  convert(to_spatial_smooth, .clean = TRUE) |>
  convert(to_largest_component)
```

## Kruger

```{r}
kruger_sfn_clean = kruger_sfn |>
  convert(to_spatial_subdivision) |>
  convert(to_spatial_smooth, .clean = TRUE) |>
  convert(to_largest_component)
```

:::


::: panel-tabset
## [**3. Explore the network**]{style="color:orange;"}

A good way to check the network you are dealing with is plotting. `sfnetworks` has a default plot method, but `ggraph` allows you a bit more flexibility when plotting your network. 

For an interactive view you can use `mapview`. 

If you got stuck and don't know how to visualize you network, see examples in the next tabs.

## Cape Town

To plot a `sfnetwork` object using the default you can just call the `plot()` function. You can also pass arguments to the nodes and edges separately. See how by typing `?plot.sfnetwork` on your R console.

```{r}
plot(ct_sfn_clean)
```

Interactive plots can be created with `mapview()`. Run the following chunk interactively in your console.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mapview(st_as_sf(ct_sfn_clean, "edges")) +
mapview(st_as_sf(ct_sfn_clean, "nodes"))
```

## Kruger

`ggraph` extends `ggplot2` to support graph structures. Developed by the same person as tidygraph, it was only logical it should work with `sfnetworks`,,

See more about using `ggraph` with `sfnetworks` objects by checking the docs ([`ggraph` website](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html), `?ggraph::geom_node_sf()`, `?ggraph::geom_edge_sf()`)

```{r}
ggraph(kruger_sfn_clean, "sf") +
  geom_node_sf(size = 0.5) + 
  geom_edge_sf(aes(color = surface)) +
  theme_bw()
```
